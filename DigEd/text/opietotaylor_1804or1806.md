My dear friend

<!-- excerpt -->I am just returned from Deptford, where I have been ever since Thursday; a sad loss of time, and nothing would have made me patient under it, but the extreme pity I feel for Miss M.'s forlorn situation. But perhaps, as my company gives her comfort, I ought not to call my visit to her a loss of time. I was lamenting to Mrs Barbauld, to whom. I related this poor orphan's story, that Miss M. did not seem to have any taste for reading. "So much the better," was her answer, "I do not think such a taste desirable. Reading is an indolent way of passing the time" -- and so she went on. I was extremely surprised, as
you may think, and began to combat her assertions; but I recollected that I had heard it said that Mrs. B., like W. Taylor, often contradicted for the sake of argument, and when I feel this, as it is a proceeding which I thoroughly disapprove, I am too angry to keep up the ball.

I find that Mrs. B. admires Cowper's letters very much. In my opinion they have been much overrated. The letters to Lady Hesketh are beautiful; but those to Hayley and J. Johnson, abounding as they do in "dearests" and "fondnesses" and "dearest of all dear Johnnies," make me sick *a la mort*.

<!-- excerpt -->You have not ridden much in stage coaches I believe, at least not round town. O what a pleasure I should lose were I to ride in my own carriage and forsake stages! I find egotism the prevailing characteristic of my fellow-travellers. This morning I found, when I entered the stage, one passenger only in it, and that was a little girl. "Are you going to town?" said I. "Yes, I know the gentleman, and so I came." "What gentleman?" "The coachman, he lives by us; and so, as I wanted to go for my shoes, he said he would take me; he promised me my shoes to wear to-day, and I am going to see after'em; I ha'known Mr. Wheeler a long time," &c. -- and so she ran on, till I was tired of listening; and convinced me egotism is of all ages. As I went down, a fine, jolly, florid young country woman, a great deal fatter than I am, was complaining to a gentleman (who informed us he was just recovered from a fit of illness) that she was very unwell too; and as she had not seen her friends at Deptford for two years, she was sure they would be quite *shocked* at the change in her, for when she left them she was quite jolly and healthy looking. I could hardly keep in my laughter at this. Her Deptford friends must be droll persons, and great amateurs in fat indeed, to be dissatisfied with her magnitude, and regret what she had lost; I protest she might have played the goddess of health at Dr. Graham's.

I shall see you now soon, and I hope to see you nearly well. Farewell! With kind love to Mr. Taylor and all the
family, I remain, *toute a vous*,

A. Opie
