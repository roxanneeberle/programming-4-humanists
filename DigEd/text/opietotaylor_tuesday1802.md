Tuesday, 1802.

My dear friend,

As opening and detaining letters to and from
active partizans is the order of the day, and as the enclosed contains *numbers*, I write to you instead of my father, and shall get my letter directed for me. Franks are now of no use, as even *Peers* can't frank, being no longer Lords of parliament; therefore, were they sacred to these *licensed* rogues, the one I have for to-morrow is good for nothing. *Indefatigable*, alias your cousin Peter, whom I saw just now at Mr. Smith's, desired me to send Lord C.'s letter; so I obey. Be so good also, as to tell my father that his letter, franked by Mr. Smith, did not reach till Saturday; and tell him I wrote to him yesterday, enclosing the peer's first letter.

Your kind answer to my statement of vexation gave me the greatest satisfaction, and I hope by your excellent advice and assistance to be able, with a very little trouble, to put such a degree of order in my subsequent *menage* as shall prevent, in future, any gross imposition. Anne's conduct since the detection, and what I have heard of it previously to it, takes from me all idea of my carelessness having led her into temptation. I believe her to be thoroughly bad.
Yesterday evening, at half-past five, we saw the balloon, from the painting-room window, distinctly. Suddenly it was lost in a cloud, and the feeling it gave me was a very strange one. Soon after it emerged again, considerably higher than it was before; then it entered another cloud and disappeared. It is past two, and Mr. Garnerin is not returned, but I have been to the Pantheon to inquire concerning him, and I find he landed at Colchester in an hour and forty minutes
Of election matters what can I say? Till I read the squibs, &c. I could not, *con amore*, say, I wished Mr. Windham to be ousted; but now indignation has assisted principle to conquer feeling, and I will not say of the agreeable delinquent,
"If to his share some manly errors fall
Hear him converse, and you'll forget them all," or, "Look in his eyes, and you'll forget them all,"  (which you please, Mrs. Taylor.) -- I was to have gone to Mr. Hiliar's on Sunday or Monday; but, if the election is to be on *Monday*, I can't leave town to be out of the way of the news on Tuesday, especially as I should not meet with sympathy in my feelings there. Adieu ! I must go to see again whether Garnerin is returned. I wonder when your travellers come back.
Believe me, ever most affectionately yours,

A. O. 

P. S. I want to come down to the election ball. What a shock poor Garnham's death was to me !
